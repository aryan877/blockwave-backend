# Blockwave Sanity Repository

This repository contains the schema and configuration for the different content types used in the Blockwave app, such as posts and users. It defines the structure of the data, its validation rules, and how it's displayed and edited in the Sanity Studio.

In addition to the schema, this repository also includes custom input components, preview components, and other studio-specific functionality to provide a seamless editing experience for the Blockwave content team.
